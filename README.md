## Overview  
The **Hypernode Load Balancer** is a high-performance distributed load-balancing system designed to optimize the communication and task distribution between nodes in the **Hypernode Network**.  
Its primary goal is to ensure scalability, fault tolerance, and efficient distribution of workload across multiple network participants, ensuring stable performance under heavy demand.  

Built in **Java**, the system supports multiple protocols and integrates seamlessly with other Hypernode network components such as the **Network-and-Communication-Infrastructure** and **Performance-Analyzer** modules.

## Core Features  
- ⚙️ **Dynamic Load Distribution:** Automatically balances workload among active nodes.  
- 🧠 **Adaptive Algorithms:** Supports weighted round-robin and latency-based balancing strategies.  
- 🔁 **Failover and Recovery:** Detects failed nodes and reassigns traffic automatically.  
- 📊 **Performance Metrics:** Monitors throughput, response time, and node utilization in real-time.  
- 🧩 **Modular Design:** Easily extendable with custom routing or metric evaluation strategies.  
- 🧱 **Integration Ready:** Compatible with the Hypernode monitoring stack and telemetry agents.

## Architecture  
The load balancer operates as a **central control node** that continuously monitors node availability and performance.  
It uses health checks and heartbeat signals from connected nodes, maintaining a registry of available compute endpoints.  
Traffic is routed according to the active algorithm, using internal scoring to dynamically adapt to network conditions.

### Core Components  
| Component | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `LoadBalancer.java` | Central controller that manages routing and distribution logic. |
| `NodeRegistry.java` | Keeps records of all available nodes and their performance data. |
| `RequestRouter.java` | Routes incoming requests to the optimal node. |
| `LoadMetricsCollector.java` | Gathers node statistics (CPU usage, response time, throughput). |
| `BalancerStrategy.java` | Interface for load-balancing algorithms (Round-Robin, Weighted, Adaptive). |
| `HealthMonitor.java` | Monitors node status and triggers failover when necessary. |

## Installation  

### Requirements  
- Java JDK 11 or later  
- Maven or Gradle build system  
- (Optional) Docker for containerized deployment  

### Steps  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hypernode-sol/Hypernode-LoadBalancer.git
   cd Hypernode-LoadBalancer
   ```
2. Build the project:  
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. Run the balancer service:  
   ```bash
   java -jar target/HypernodeLoadBalancer-0.1.0.jar
   ```

---

## Configuration  
The balancer’s behavior can be customized through configuration files or environment variables.

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| `PORT` | Server listening port | `8080` |
| `STRATEGY` | Load-balancing algorithm (`round_robin`, `weighted`, `adaptive`) | `adaptive` |
| `HEALTH_INTERVAL_MS` | Interval for node health checks | `3000` |
| `MAX_LATENCY_MS` | Latency threshold before node is deprioritized | `500` |

Example environment setup:
```bash
export PORT=9090
export STRATEGY=weighted
export HEALTH_INTERVAL_MS=5000
java -jar target/HypernodeLoadBalancer-0.1.0.jar
```

---

## Usage  
Once started, the balancer listens for incoming connections from both clients and nodes.  

### Register a node  
Nodes can register through an API or communication protocol supported by the balancer:  
```bash
POST /register
{
  "nodeId": "node-001",
  "host": "192.168.1.10",
  "port": 9000,
  "weight": 10
}
```

### Send a request  
The balancer automatically forwards requests to the most suitable node.  
You can monitor distribution logs in real time or integrate the telemetry module for visual dashboards.
